The Xbox 360 Controller only works on the Linux Build.

Pressing escape exits the game, or pressing start and select at the same time on the controller, or by pausing and clicking exit.

The work that I did was the main game engine, grid area scripts, the character scripts, the item scripts, and the controller scripts.
