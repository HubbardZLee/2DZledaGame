Was planning on giving a detailed rundown of my code here.
Its 430 AM though and my brain is dead so fuck it.
Everything should be commented well enough in each class file.
I'll see you guys in class. I'll work on this later.


One thing you guys do need to know though is that if you try to just take certain 
script files, you HAVE to import the 'InputManager.asset' file in the project settings folder
into your own project settings folder erasing the one that you have. This is the only way 
that the button mappings will connect to work.
